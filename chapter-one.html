			<h1> Chapter One:</h1><h2>The Augurs of Spring</h2>
			
				<p>


					Piotr awoke, he's not quite awake, warm in his bed. No point in moving just yet, the room is still dark. 

					Something extraordinary had stirred him. The eaves of the house were flowing with chatter, geese honking, crunching steps in 

					the last snow of winter. It hadn't snowed in about four weeks, but still, the snow stood meters high in narrow

					areas where it could gather. 
				</p>
			
			<p>


					There are more people than young Piotr has ever seen. "There must be over two ten-teen!" he told his brother Roma.

					A fresh white blouse with a red waistcoat and a pair of blue trousers are neatly placed on a chair in the 

					boys room. "Go eat some, Idi Poyesh!" [1] his mother said happily passing in the hall. 

					His father "Roma! Piotr! Yes Davai!"[2] 

			</p>
			
			<p>

					A large crowd are still slowly shuffling past the windows, murmuring and giggling, they are making an early start to the festival.

					"Nu khvatit Fyodor!" [3] his hand stops short of another blinchiki[6], he dips the one he has for a second time into the flush jar of honey. Katyusha, Fyodor's wife gives him the same disapproving glance she gives to the kids when they are greedy. 

					<i>He deserves it.</i> [4]
			</p>
				
			<p>
					Great Auntie Gaila not impressed with much of anything, doubles the disapproving look and glances toward the crowd still moving past the window. She mutters something about Fyodors appetite and how big his belly has gotten. Half of what she said is heard "What was that Baba Gailia?" 

					"Nichevo" [5] she smiles as the boys come down the open stairs. 

					The boys move past a living room full of dead things, stuffed bears and foxes, pictures of relatives adorned with fake gold flake and dull gold paint in wooden frames. This part of the house smells like dust and is better moved through at pace to get to the kitchen table. 
					
					"Baba Gaila!" the boys rush to meet their Great Aunts open arms. "When did you get here Baba, with all the snow?" asks Roma. "The snow?" explains Galia ".. my dear boy I simply transform into a crow and fly here don't you know?" the boys laugh at their silly Auntie, "go eat, you will be leaving soon".
         </p> 
         <p>
					Piotr, still not dressed in the clothes laid out for him weeks ago, sits at the part of the table that is covered in the morning sun. The light cascades through the open pot of honey, it creates refractions of amber light across the table. The people still passing by the kitchen windows in the hurried murmur and clattering of fixtures. Romas mouth is stuffed with pancakes, so is Piotors. Fyodor passes back the look his wife had given him. Breakfast is over. Piotr, Roma and Fyodor need to be dressed. 

					The rabble gets more concentrated toward the front door.

			[1]IDI POYESH!! (A nice way of saying 'Go eat some')"
			[2]YES DAVAI!" (Eat already!!! - hurry up!!).
			[3]"Nu khvatit Fyodor!" (well enough! * No that's enough)
			[4] He's come into money over the past year and has been 		    very observant of peace in the home. 
				She remembers that it has only been a year since he was found in the snow, drunk out of his mind. ]<hr>
			[5]This is kind of the point of having these words here in the first place. Sure this 
				bit of the page is not even been served. Nichevo 'Nothing' it means nothing. 
			[6]Missed this one here, it means a little pancake, like a bilini, its a cute way of saying it.
			[7]Doors in russia go 'Stuk Stuk Stuk' -->
