  <h1> Chapter One:</h1><h2>The Augurs of Spring</h2>
  
  <p>


Piotr awoke, he's not quite awake, warm in his bed. No point in moving just yet, the room is still dark. 

Something extraordinary had stirred him. The eaves of the house were flowing with chatter, geese honking, crunching steps in 

the last snow of winter. It hadn't snowed in about 4 weeks, but still, the snow stood meters high in narrow

areas where it could gather.

There are more people than young Piotr has ever seen. "There must be over two ten-teen!" he told his brother Roma.

A fresh white blouse with a red waistcoat and a pair of blue trousers are neatly placed on a chair in the 

boys room. "Go eat some, IDI POYESH!! (A nice way of saying 'Go eat some')" his mother said passing in the hall. 

His father "Roma! Piotr! YES DAVAI!" (Eat already!!! - hurry up!!).

A large crowd are still slowly shuffling past the windows, murmuring and giggling, they are making an early start to the festival.

"Nu khvatit Fyodor!" (well enough! * No that's enough) his hand stops short of another blinchiki, he dips the one he has for a second time into the flush jar of honey. Katyusha, Fyodor's wife gives him the same disapproving glance she gives to the kids when they are greedy. 

He deserves it. [ He's come into money over the past year and has been very observant of peacetime in the home. 

She remembers that it has only been a year since he was found in the snow, drunk out of his mind. ]

Great Auntie Gaila not impressed with much of anything, doubles the disapproving look and glances toward the crowd still moving past the window. She mutters something about Fyodors appetite and how big his belly has gotten. Half of what she said is heard "What was that Baba Gailia?" 

"Nichevo" she smiles as the boys come down the open stairs. 

The boys move past a living room full of dead things, stuffed bears and foxes, pictures of relatives adorned with fake gold flake and dull gold paint in wooden frames. This part of the house smells like dust and is better moved through at pace to get to the kitchen table. 

Piotr, still not dressed in the clothes laid out for him weeks ago, sits at the part of the table that is covered in the morning sun. The light cascades through the open pot of honey, it creates refractions of amber light across the table. The people still passing by the kitchen windows in the hurried murmur and clattering of fixtures. Romas mouth is stuffed with pancakes, so is Piotors. Fyodor passes back the look his wife had given him. Breakfast is over. Piotr, Roma and Fyodor need to be dressed. 

The rabble gets more concentrated toward the front door.
