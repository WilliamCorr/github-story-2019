		<h1> Chapter Three:</h1><h2> Ritual of the Rival Tribes</h2>
		
		<h3>
		Stuk Stuk Stuk... 
		</h3>
		<p>
		"Who's baba is the baba yaga?" piotor now standing up in the cart, furiously demanding curiosity be satiated. "Sit down Piotor, you'll fall and wake uncle"

		</p>
		<p>
		The baba yaga, is no ones baba explained Roma in a cautious tone. She is a little old lady who lives in the woods "She sounds nice" smiled Piotor. "She's not" rapidly snapped Roma, she is the grandmother of Satan. She does not wear a pointed black hat or ride upon a broom he explained, but she has a long nose and sharp wooden teeth. "Dont worry little brother, unless you can not do what she asks from you, then there is no problem..." he went on to explain the tasks must simply be to gather all the wood in the forest in a day, spin all the cotton into yarn in that same forest and fill her bath using a sieve. Roma smiling like an ass,
		
		</p>
		<p>
		"if I forgot to say already, she eats children who can not do her chores, you probably wont be able to do her chores Piotor, I am just telling you now, before we get there so it wont be a shock for you." Chaining hurrdily the details together before their uncle might be woken by a bump in the road. "Oh yeah! I forgot to say. Her house stands up on two great big chicken feet, so even if she doesnt see you, the house will. You have to say the magic words, "turn your back to the forest, and your front to me!"
	
		</p>
		<p>
		
		"I was there once you know,I said the magic words and the house had a roosters head on the roof and it looked and me and screamed, the house turned towards me and starting walking. I simply said "Izboushka, stoy!" Then I rescued a girl from the baba yaga's dirty hut, she was a princess but she lives in another country, thats why you've never met her."
		</p>
		<p>
				
		Piotr is captivated and a little scared believing every word his brother lays upon him. "poslushay little brother, if you do not take my warnings seriously, the baba yaga will make you gather wood all day and kick you into the fire you supplied, or make you gather water with a bucket that has a hole in it, from a spring full of toads and spiders. She will turn your bones into the front gate of her garden. 
		</p>
		 
		<p>
		Uncle wakes. "Roma! Stoy!" he's been listening for a few minutes, Piotr is white as snow. "My bones..." whines Piotr. Your brother is an idiot, that's what everyone had always said to Piotr. It's gotten dark, the crowds from the village walk either side of the road in odd pairs. The geese in their arms are getting noisey. The cart slows up, there is a giant tree. "It's got no leaves on it" Piotr arches his head way up "We are going to do something about that Piotr". Piotrs party dismount, the crowds laugh and gather single file into a dark forrest, the branches are matted together and the roots are deep and raised around the trees. The people, carrying torches, weaving about chatting happily making their way toward the smell of cooking, geeses honkng.
